Apache Tomcat is another product released by the Apache Software Foundation. It is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies. Tomcat is a web server used for hosting the Java-based web application. Apache Tomcat team has announced its latest Tomcat 9.0.26 release. This article helps you to install Tomcat 9 on Ubuntu 19.04, 18.04 LTS & 16.04 LTS systems.

### 1: Java Installation
You must have Java installed on the system before installing Apache Tomcat on a Linux VPS. Tomcat 9 required Java 8 or later version to work. You can check and verify that Java is installed with the right version.
```java
java version "11.0.2" 2019-01-15 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS, mixed mode)
```

If you donâ€™t have Java installed on your system or installed a lower version, run below commands to satisfy requirements.
```java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```

### 2: Download & Install Tomcat 9
You need to download the Tomcat archive from its official download website or mirrors. Download and Install Tomcat 9 archive file using the following commands. You can also visit official download page to download latest available version.
```java
wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.26/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.26.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-tomcat-9.0.26.tar.gz
sudo mv apache-tomcat-9.0.26 /usr/local/apache-tomcat9
```

### 3: Configure Environment Variables
Now configure the required environment variables for the Tomcat. Set CATALINA_HOME to the extracted tomcat directory. Also, set Java environment variables as per Java installed on your system.
```java
echo "export CATALINA_HOME="/usr/local/apache-tomcat9"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export JRE_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 4: Setup Tomcat User Accounts
Finally we need to create user accounts to secure and access admin/manager pages. Edit `conf/tomcat-users.xml` file in your editor and paste inside `<tomcat-users> </tomcat-users>` tags.
```xml
<!-- user manager can access only manager section -->
<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<user username="manager" password="_SECRET_PASSWORD_" roles="manager-gui" />

<!-- user admin can access manager and admin section both -->
<role rolename="admin-gui" />
<user username="admin" password="_SECRET_PASSWORD_" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui" />
```
 
### 5: Enable Host/Manager for Remote IP
The default manager and host-manager web pages are enabled to access from localhost only. To access these pages from the remote system, you have to allow your IP or IP range in the application-specific context.xml file.

Manager File: **./webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml**

Host Manager File: `./webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml`

Edit above files and add your IP address like the screenshot. After making changes restart Tomcat service.
